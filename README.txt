== Description ==

Simple Widget that allows adding single or multiple images to your widget positions. Its using native media uploader. You can add caption for each image that will show below it, or you can use it as banner advertising module because its not being blocked with Ad Blocker. It doesnâ€™t load any script on front end so its super fast.
